    <!-- Contains a URL or a URL fragment that the hyperlink points to. A URL fragment is a name preceded by a hash mark (#), which specifies an internal target location (an id of an HTML element) within the current document. URLs are not restricted to Web (HTTP)-based documents, but can use any protocol supported by the browser. For example, file:, ftp:, and mailto: work in most browsers.

    Note: You can use href="#top" or the empty fragment href="#" to link to the top of the current page. This behavior is specified by HTML5.
